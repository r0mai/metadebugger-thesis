Sven Mikael Persson implemented a similar metadebugger based on a fork of
Templight he developed\cite{persson-templight}. He uses a different approach,
since his tool stops the execution of the compiler instead of re-simulating
the compilation process after it finishes. His approach makes it easier to
access arbitrary internal information at that particular point of the
compilation, but makes implementing features like \texttt{forwardtrace} or
stepping backwards very difficult.

Borók-Nagy, Porkoláb and Mihalicza, the creators of Templight\cite{templight}
implemented a tool called Templar\cite{templar}. Templar can also be used to
inspect the inner workings of a template metaprogram. It has a Qt\cite{qt}
based graphical user interface and uses graphviz\cite{graphviz} to draw call
graphs.
