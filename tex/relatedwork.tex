Sven Mikael Persson implemented a similar metadebugger based on a fork of
Templight he developed.\cite{persson-templight} He uses a different approach,
since his tool stops the execution of the compiler instead of re-simluating
the compilation process after the it finishes. His approach makes it easier to
access arbitrary internal information at that particular point of the
compilation, but makes implementing features like \texttt{forwardtrace} or
stepping backwards very difficult.
