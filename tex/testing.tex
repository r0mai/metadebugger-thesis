\subsection{Black-box testing}

The following functionalities and program behaviors can be tested using
black-box testing method:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Entered commands
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Valid commands produce expected outputs
        \item Invalid commands are rejected with an appropriate error message
    \end{itemize}
    \item Only the appropriate lines are appended to the command history
    %TODO more?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{White-box testing}

The classes and functions created were implemented with white-box testing in
mind. This means, that the functionality is broken down into small standalone
pieces, each testable on its own.
