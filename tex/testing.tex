\chapter{Testing}

The Just\cite{just} test library was used to write automated unit and
integration tests.

%TODO

\section{Test plan}

%TODO is this really a Test *plan*?

The aim was to get as close to 100 percent code coverage with automated tests
as possible. The written tests can be divided into two categories:

\begin{description}
    \item[Unit tests:] \hfill \\
        Unit tests call low level functions directly and inspect the returned
        value for correctness.
    \item[Integration tests:] \hfill \\
        Integration tests use an instance of the \texttt{test\_mdb\_shell}
        class, which inherits from \texttt{mdb\_shell} and can be used to
        simulate user input and verify the displayed output.
\end{description}

\section{Unit and integration tests} \label{tests}

143 unit and integration tests were written. Both types of tests use the Just
test library and are compiled into the same test executable:
\verb$bin/test/metashell_test$
