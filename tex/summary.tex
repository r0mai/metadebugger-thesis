\section{Results}

A talk titled TODO was given by √Åbel Sinkovics and me on December 1st, 2014 on
a C++ Community Meetup in Budapest TODOCITE and on December 6st, 2014 on the
2014 MeetingC++ conference in Berlin TODOCITE. The second half of the talk was
consisted of a brief introduction to Metadebugger and its internal structure,
and a demo showcasing the most important features.

\section{Possible further improvements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Further commands based on user feedback will be implemented.
    \item
        Ability to debug metaprograms, even if the compilation failed, but
        templight produced output.
    \item
        Currently neither the source location of the templates nor the source
        location of the point of instantiation is avaliable to the user. For
        this to work correctly modification of Templight is required, because
        it doesn't supply enought information to Metadebugger.
    \item
        Smart formatting and indentation of very long template type names.
    %TODO more (add modularization maybe?)
\end{itemize}
