\section{Results}

To this date two talks were given on this topic, both by √Åbel Sinkovics and me.
A talk titled "Template Metaprogramming With Better Tools" was given on
December 1st, 2014 on a C++ Community Meetup in Budapest\cite{cpp-meetup}
and another was presented on December 6th, 2014 on the MeetingC++ conference in
Berlin with the title "Interactive Metaprogramming Shell
Based on Clang"\cite{meeting-cpp}. The second half of the talks consisted of a
brief introduction to Metadebugger and its internal structure, and a demo
showcasing the most important features.

\section{Possible further improvements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Further commands based on user feedback will be implemented.
    \item
        Ability to debug metaprograms, even if the compilation failed, but
        templight produced output.
    \item
        Make the source location of point of instantiation avaliable to the
        user.
    \item
        Smart formatting and indentation of very long template type names.
    %TODO more (add modularization maybe?)
\end{itemize}
