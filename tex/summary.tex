\section{Results}

A talk titled "Template Metaprogramming With Better Tools" was given by √Åbel
Sinkovics and me on December 1st, 2014 on a C++ Community
Meetup\cite{cpp-meetup} in Budapest and on December 6th, 2014 on the
MeetingC++ conference\cite{meeting-cpp} in Berlin. The second half of the talks
was consisted of a brief introduction to Metadebugger and its internal
structure, and a demo showcasing the most important features.

\section{Possible further improvements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Further commands based on user feedback will be implemented.
    \item
        Ability to debug metaprograms, even if the compilation failed, but
        templight produced output.
    \item
        Currently neither the source location of the templates nor the source
        location of the point of instantiation is avaliable to the user. For
        this to work correctly modification of Templight is required, because
        it doesn't supply enought information to Metadebugger.
    \item
        Smart formatting and indentation of very long template type names.
    %TODO more (add modularization maybe?)
\end{itemize}
