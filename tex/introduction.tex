\section{Motivation}

Programs often don't work the way their programmers intended. While some
problems can be fixed just by observing the produced output, most of them
require tools that enable the programmer to inspect what happens exactly
during runtime. These tools are called debuggers.

Most popular programming languages and runtime environments provide debuggers
for the programmers. Unfortunately no such tool existed for C++ Template
Metaprograms. Metaprogram developers used to rely on the cryptic and sometimes
multiple pages long error and warning messages produced by the compiler to
debug their code. Decoding these error messages can take hours or sometimes
even days. Clearly, there is a need for a tool which makes this process easier.

Metadebugger tries to fill this hole by providing an easy to use tool, which
can be used to inspect what happens while a C++ compiler compiles a
metaprogram.

Metadebugger uses Clang with Templight behind the scenes to gather the
necessary information about the evaluated metaprograms.
