\section{Motivation}

Programs often don't work the way their programmers intended. While some
problems can be fixed just by observing the produced output, most of them
require tools that enable the programmer to inspect what happens exactly
during runtime. These tools are called debuggers.

Most popular programming languages and runtime environments provide debuggers
for the programmers. Unfortunately no such tool existed for C++ Template
Metaprograms. Metadebugger tries to fill this hole by providing an easy to use
tool, which can be used to inspect what happens while a C++ compiler compiles a
metaprogram.

Metadebugger uses Clang with Templight behind the scenes to gather the
necessary information about the evaluated metaprograms.
